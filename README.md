# AYNA
AYNA(All You Need for Agronomy) is a website particularly  for the Indian Farmers to provide all information in one portal. AYNA also stands for mirror in Hindi. Same as a mirror our website also reflects out all the info that’s out there without misleading. A farmer will be able to get all relevant information on specific subjects around his state.
